# Releasing and publishing packages

`orchestrator` release artifacts are built and published automatically by the [`Release` workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml). The workflow fires on any pushed tag matching `v*` and produces:

- `tar.gz`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` packages attached to a GitHub Release
- A multi-arch Docker image pushed to `ghcr.io/proxysql/orchestrator`

Both artifact sets cover `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Triggering a release

```
    git tag v4.30.1
    git push origin v4.30.1
```

That's the whole trigger. The workflow picks up the tag name as the release version, strips the leading `v`, and uses `4.30.1` for package versions and Docker tags.

### Prerelease (release candidate) tags

Tags that contain `rc` (e.g. `v4.30.1-rc1`) are handled specially:

- The GitHub Release is marked as a prerelease.
- The Docker `latest` tag is **not** updated — only the specific version tags are pushed.

Use this for testing the release pipeline end-to-end on a fork before cutting a real release.

## What runs

The workflow has three jobs:

### 1. `build-and-release` (matrix: amd64, arm64)

Runs on `ubuntu-latest` (amd64) and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (arm64) — GitHub's native ARM runners, free for public repos. No QEMU, no cross-compilation: each job builds on its own native architecture, so CGO (`go-sqlite3`) works without any special toolchain.

Each matrix job:

1. Installs Go, `fpm`, and `rpmbuild`.
2. Runs `./build.sh -a <goarch>` with `RELEASE_VERSION` set from the tag.
3. Collects everything `build.sh` writes to `/tmp/orchestrator-release/` and uploads it to the GitHub Release.

Per arch, `build.sh` produces three variants (see `package_linux` in [`build.sh`](../build.sh)):

- `orchestrator` — full package (binary + web resources + sample configs + systemd unit)
- `orchestrator-cli` — binary only
- `orchestrator-client` — the `orchestrator-client` shell script only

Each variant is emitted as `.tar.gz`, `.deb`, and `.rpm`. Package names differ by arch (`_amd64.deb` / `_arm64.deb`, `.x86_64.rpm` / `.aarch64.rpm`), so the two matrix jobs don't collide when uploading to the same Release.

Both matrix jobs call `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` — the action is idempotent and will attach to the existing Release created by whichever job finishes first.

### 2. `docker-build` (matrix: linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

Each arch builds [`docker/Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile) natively on its own runner and pushes **by digest** to `ghcr.io/proxysql/orchestrator` (no tag yet). The digest is uploaded as a workflow artifact for the merge job to consume.

### 3. `Promote Release` workflow

After the signed package release is public, dispatch
`.github/workflows/promote-release.yml` with the release tag and the successful
build workflow run ID. It verifies that the tag, build run, and public GitHub
Release all identify the same commit before downloading both digests. It then
runs `docker/metadata-action` to compute tags from the git tag:

- `type=semver,pattern={{version}}` — e.g. `4.30.1`
- `type=semver,pattern={{major}}.{{minor}}` — e.g. `4.30`
- `type=raw,value=latest` — only when the tag does **not** contain `rc`

It uses `docker buildx imagetools create` to assemble a multi-arch manifest
under those tags and verifies that the result contains both amd64 and arm64.

## Verifying a release

### GitHub Release page

After the workflow completes, the Release page should list (for version `X.Y.Z`):

```
orchestrator-X.Y.Z-linux-amd64.tar.gz
orchestrator-X.Y.Z-linux-arm64.tar.gz
orchestrator_X.Y.Z-1_amd64.deb
orchestrator_X.Y.Z-1_arm64.deb
orchestrator-X.Y.Z-1.x86_64.rpm
orchestrator-X.Y.Z-1.aarch64.rpm
```

Plus the `-cli` and `-client` variants in `.deb` and `.rpm` form for each arch.

### Docker manifest

```
    docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/proxysql/orchestrator:X.Y.Z
```

The output should list both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` entries.

Pull and smoke-test each arch:

```
    docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/proxysql/orchestrator:X.Y.Z orchestrator --version
    docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/proxysql/orchestrator:X.Y.Z orchestrator --version
```

## Local reproduction

The release workflow does the same thing you can do locally with `build.sh` — see [Building and testing](build.md) and [`build.sh`](../build.sh). To produce ARM64 packages on a non-ARM host (outside of CI), run inside an arm64 container:

```
    docker run --rm -it --platform linux/arm64 \
      -v $PWD:/src -w /src \
      ubuntu:24.04 bash -c '
        apt-get update &&
        apt-get install -y golang git ruby ruby-dev build-essential rpm &&
        gem install --no-document fpm &&
        ./build.sh -a arm64
      '
```

## Permissions and secrets

The workflow relies on `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` (for the Release) and `packages: write` (for GHCR) — both declared in [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml). No additional secrets are required.

## Troubleshooting

- **Workflow didn't run after tagging.** The tag must start with `v` (see the `on.push.tags` filter). Tags pushed without `git push --tags` or without pushing the specific ref won't trigger it.
- **A matrix job failed mid-way and part of the release is missing.** The workflow uses `fail-fast: false`, so the other arch still completes. Re-running only the failed job from the Actions UI is safe — the GitHub Release and GHCR both accept re-uploads (fpm uses `-f` to overwrite, `action-gh-release` replaces files of the same name).
- **Docker manifest is missing one arch.** If `docker-build` succeeded for only one arch, `docker-merge` will still run but `imagetools create` will produce a single-arch manifest. Re-run the failed `docker-build` job, then re-run `docker-merge`.
